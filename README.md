Motor-Insurance-Data-Analysis
Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing motor insurance data to gain actionable insights into customer behavior, claim patterns, and policy performance. Using **SQL** for data processing and **Power BI** for visualization, the project aims to help insurance companies optimize risk assessment, improve customer segmentation, and enhance business decisions.
